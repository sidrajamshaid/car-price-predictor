# 🚗 Car Price Predictor Using Linear Regression

A sleek, interactive **machine learning web app** that estimates used car prices based on details like year, mileage, brand, and condition — all in real time 🧠💸

Built with:

- 🧪 **Scikit-learn** for model building
- 🎨 **Streamlit** for a user-friendly interface
- 🚀 **Hugging Face Spaces** for public deployment

## 💡 How the Model Was Built (My AI Work)

Here’s a breakdown of what I did in the project 👇

### 📦 1. Data Preparation

- Cleaned and filtered the **Craigslist car dataset**
- Removed noisy data and handled null/missing values
- Selected meaningful features:
  - `year`, `odometer`, `manufacturer`, `fuel`, `transmission`, `condition`, `cylinders`, etc.

### 🧠 2. Model Pipeline

- Encoded categorical variables using `OneHotEncoder`
- Scaled numerical features using `StandardScaler`
- Combined preprocessing and **Linear Regression** into a single pipeline using `Pipeline`

### 📈 3. Training & Evaluation

- Trained on real-world used car data
- Model Performance:
  - 📊 **R² Score** ≈ 0.78
  - 📉 **RMSE** ≈ 5686
- Exported trained pipeline as `car_price_model.pkl` using `joblib`

### 🖥️ 4. App Integration & Deployment

- Developed a fully functional Streamlit app for live predictions
- Styled the UI with custom CSS
- Connected the model to Hugging Face Spaces for easy access

cd car-price-predictor
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

###  **📉 Dataset Note**

> ⚠️ **Note:** The dataset file **vehicles.csv** is **not included** in this repository because it exceeds GitHub’s file size limit (100 MB).

> To retrain the model or explore the data:

* > 🔗 Download it from [**Kaggle - Craigslist Car Listings**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data)
  >
* > 📂 Save the file as **vehicles.csv** in the project’s **root directory**
  >
* > 🛠️ Then you can rerun the notebook or retrain the model
